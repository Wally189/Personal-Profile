            French language - I'm also learning Italian. In general I enjoy learning about other languages and cultures. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I walk a lot - living in County Donegal I'm' surrounded by amazing countryside and it would be a travesty
            not to make use of it! I enjoy gardening - I grow fruit and vegetables, somewhere in my mind is an dream of
            living 'The Good Life'!
            <br>
            <br>
            I love to read - I enjoy Adventure, Crime, Thriller and Historical fiction genres - favourite authors
            include Kate Mosse, Robert Ludlum and Ann Cleeves. Non-fiction interests include history, politics, religion
            and philosophy. That said, I read pretty much anything!

                        creating things rather than fixing them! Throughout 2022 I will upskill and ensure I am
                        competent in the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL.</p>
